		<h2>Grand Opening</h2>
		<p>Bill and Paula White just opened up a new Bed and Breakfast in the Alpharetta area called

		small refrigerator, microwave, and a 32 in. flat screen TV. There is a complimentary continental 
		breakfast (Danish, bagels, orange juice, cereal, oatmeal, coffee and tea, 
		etc.) Small pets are welcome for an additional fee. Please call to inquire about it. We also have a
